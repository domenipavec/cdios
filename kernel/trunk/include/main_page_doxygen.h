/** @mainpage CDIOS documentation
 * @section intro Introduction
 * I am not planning to make this thing public,
 * I am purely doing this for my own use, and maybe
 * a bit of proof I realy did this. Maybe one day this
 * will be huge project and will really need documentation
 * because of many developers, but for now
 * it is just me and 50 lines of code.
 *
 * @section plan Planing
 * I am developing this to make an OS primarily
 * meant for overclocking and PC repair. It will
 * only support modern stuff, and now this is 
 * 64 bit mode.
